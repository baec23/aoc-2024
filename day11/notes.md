0 -> 1
even number of digits ->
two stones
left: first half
right: second half
else -> \* 2024

after 25 iterations ? how many stones

probably can't use long - too high
how to do mult ?

====

key: stone + numIterations
num after numIterations

key: stone
vector<Stone> next stones

====
0 1 1 99 99

0 -> 1
1 -> 2024
99 -> 9, 9

// This might not even be necessary actually
stone -> nextStones map
<string, vector<Stone>>

numStones map
<string, long>
